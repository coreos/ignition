# This unit must the first to run when the disk holding the root partition
# becomes available. To avoid relying on the name of the root partition which
# is different between RHCOS LUKS setup and current FCOS setup, we wait for the
# partition labeled 'boot' to become available. This is reliable as we don't
# have any plan to support re-provisioning/re-writing the /boot partition,
#
# This is the only unit where it is safe to wait only on a specific disk label
# as this will call udevadm settle after the GPT setup. Units that requires the
# boot and root partitions to be available should order themselves after this
# unit.
