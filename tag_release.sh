# TODO(vc): generate NEWS as part of the release process.
# @marineam suggested using git notes to associate NEWS-destined payloads
# with objects, we just need to define a syntax and employ them.
# I would like to be able to write the NEWS annotation as part of the commit message,
# while still having it go into a note.
